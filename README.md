# Hi there, I'm Yaamin! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm a **Frontend Developer** and a current **Software Engineering** student at the **University of Karachi**. Alongside my studies, Iâ€™m enrolled in the **SMIT (Saylani Mass IT) Training Program**, where Iâ€™m learning even more about web development and refining my skills. 

I love creating clean, responsive, and user-friendly websites and applications. My journey as a developer has been all about learning, experimenting, and building projects that not only look great but also work smoothly. Whether itâ€™s a personal project or something for a client, Iâ€™m always excited to bring ideas to life with code!
